summary: <p>Always wanted to have your private&nbsp;movie theater and screen only
  the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but
  how can you sell tickets? Having a booth is&nbsp;old-fashioned, so&nbsp;let&#39;s
  create a special service for that!&nbsp;Make good use of Spring and write a REST
  service that can&nbsp;show the available seats,&nbsp;sell and&nbsp;refund tickets,&nbsp;and
  display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!</p><br/><br/>Learn
